# CaseStudy1
This is a project created for MSDS 6306: Case Study 1 by Noelle Brown and Ann Nelson.

## Introduction:
   This study is marketing research for the “Best Brew in Town” Brewery (B2T), who is interested in expanding into a new territory.  We will be determining the best location, and the brew characteristics based on a data set of 2410 US craft beers and a Breweries dataset contains 558 US breweries.

## Conclusion:
    We recommend B2T Brewery expand into <state>.  The beer characteristics most popular in that are <> Alcohol Content and <> International Bitterness Unit.  <maybe some discussion of how this compares to the max ABV values/IBU values if there is something interesting there> or <some discussion about the relationship between ABV and IBU>.
